# Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB)

This repository contains source code and Jupyter notebooks for the second-stage
classification of Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) microscopy images.

The implementation focuses on post-detection refinement using deep learning
models to improve classification performance in microscopy-based TB screening.

## Repository Structure
- AFB_detect.py, detect.py: Python scripts for preprocessing and inference
- notebooks/: Experimental and training notebooks (outputs cleared)
- .gitignore: Excludes datasets, model weights, and temporary files

## Dataset
The microscopy image dataset is **not hosted in this GitHub repository** due to
size constraints and data governance considerations.

The dataset is available at:
- **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K9WxlGF1BI3fuac9btY1DA0NIKLmD0gx?usp=drive_link**
